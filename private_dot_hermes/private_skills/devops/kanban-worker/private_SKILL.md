# Kanban Worker — Pitfalls and Examples

> You're seeing this skill because the Hermes Kanban dispatcher spawned you as a worker with `--skills kanban-worker` — it's loaded automatically for every dispatched worker. The **lifecycle** (6 steps: orient → work → heartbeat → block/complete) also lives in the `KANBAN_GUIDANCE` block that's auto-injected into your system prompt. This skill is the deeper detail: good handoff shapes, retry diagnostics, edge cases.

## Workspace handling

Your workspace kind determines how you should behave inside `$HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACE`:

| Kind | What it is | How to work |
|---|---|---|
| `scratch` | Fresh tmp dir, yours alone | Read/write freely; it gets GC'd when the task is archived. |
| `dir:<path>` | Shared persistent directory | Other runs will read what you write. Treat it like long-lived state. Path is guaranteed absolute (the kernel rejects relative paths). |
| `worktree` | Git worktree at the resolved path | If `.git` doesn't exist, run `git worktree add <path> ${HERMES_KANBAN_BRANCH:-wt/$HERMES_KANBAN_TASK}` from the main repo first, then cd and work normally. |

### Profile `worktree: true` vs Kanban workspace kind

When diagnosing Kanban worker startup failures, distinguish the task's `workspace_kind` from the assignee profile's CLI config. A task can be `workspace_kind: scratch` while the assignee profile has top-level `worktree: true` in `~/.hermes/profiles/<assignee>/config.yaml`. In that case the dispatcher still spawns the worker inside the scratch workspace, but Hermes startup treats the profile setting like `hermes -w` and tries to create a git worktree from the current directory. If the scratch workspace is empty/non-git, the worker exits before the agent loop with:

```text
✗ --worktree requires being inside a git repository.
  cd into your project repo first, then run hermes -w
```

Do not assume this means the Kanban card itself was created as a `worktree` workspace or that a child card caused the failure. Inspect the assignee profile config and the dispatcher spawn path. For board status explanations, say that board `children` are dependency-DAG successors, not necessarily tasks created by the current failing worker run.

## Tenant isolation

If `$HERMES_TENANT` is set, the task belongs to a tenant namespace. When reading or writing persistent memory, prefix memory entries with the tenant so context doesn't leak across tenants:

- Good: `business-a: Acme is our biggest customer`
- Bad (leaks): `Acme is our biggest customer`

## Good summary + metadata shapes

The `kanban_complete(summary=..., metadata=...)` handoff is how downstream workers read what you did. Patterns that work:

**Coding task:**
```python
kanban_complete(
    summary="shipped rate limiter — token bucket, keys on user_id with IP fallback, 14 tests pass",
    metadata={
        "changed_files": ["rate_limiter.py", "tests/test_rate_limiter.py"],
        "tests_run": 14,
        "tests_passed": 14,
        "decisions": ["user_id primary, IP fallback for unauthenticated requests"],
    },
)
```

**Coding task that needs human review (review-required):**

For most code-changing tasks, the work isn't truly *done* until a human reviewer has eyes on it. Block instead of complete, with `reason` prefixed `review-required: ` so the dashboard surfaces the row as needing review. Drop the structured metadata (changed files, test counts, diff/PR url) into a comment first, since `kanban_block` only carries the human-readable reason — comments are the durable annotation channel. Reviewer either approves and runs `hermes kanban unblock <id>` (which re-spawns you with the comment thread for any follow-ups) or asks for changes via another comment.

```python
import json

kanban_comment(
    body="review-required handoff:\n" + json.dumps({
        "changed_files": ["rate_limiter.py", "tests/test_rate_limiter.py"],
        "tests_run": 14,
        "tests_passed": 14,
        "diff_path": "/path/to/worktree",  # or PR url if pushed
        "decisions": ["user_id primary, IP fallback for unauthenticated requests"],
    }, indent=2),
)
kanban_block(
    reason="review-required: rate limiter shipped, 14/14 tests pass — needs eyes on the user_id/IP fallback choice before merging",
)
```

Use `kanban_complete` only when the task is genuinely terminal — e.g. a one-line typo fix, a docs change with no functional consequences, or a research task where the artifact IS the writeup itself.

**Research task:**
```python
kanban_complete(
    summary="3 competing libraries reviewed; vLLM wins on throughput, SGLang on latency, Tensorrt-LLM on memory efficiency",
    metadata={
        "sources_read": 12,
        "recommendation": "vLLM",
        "benchmarks": {"vllm": 1.0, "sglang": 0.87, "trtllm": 0.72},
    },
)
```

**Review task:**
```python
kanban_complete(
    summary="reviewed PR #123; 2 blocking issues found (SQL injection in /search, missing CSRF on /settings)",
    metadata={
        "pr_number": 123,
        "findings": [
            {"severity": "critical", "file": "api/search.py", "line": 42, "issue": "raw SQL concat"},
            {"severity": "high", "file": "api/settings.py", "issue": "missing CSRF middleware"},
        ],
        "approved": False,
    },
)
```

Shape `metadata` so downstream parsers (reviewers, aggregators, schedulers) can use it without re-reading your prose.

## Claiming cards you actually created

If your run produced new kanban tasks (via `kanban_create`), pass the ids in `created_cards` on `kanban_complete`. The kernel verifies each id exists and was created by your profile; any phantom id blocks the completion with an error listing what went wrong, and the rejected attempt is permanently recorded on the task's event log. **Only list ids you captured from a successful `kanban_create` return value — never invent ids from prose, never paste ids from earlier runs, never claim cards another worker created.**

```python
# GOOD — capture return values, then claim them.
c1 = kanban_create(title="remediate SQL injection", assignee="security-worker")
c2 = kanban_create(title="fix CSRF middleware", assignee="web-worker")

kanban_complete(
    summary="Review done; spawned remediations for both findings.",
    metadata={"pr_number": 123, "approved": False},
    created_cards=[c1["task_id"], c2["task_id"]],
)
```

```python
# BAD — claiming ids you don't have captured return values for.
kanban_complete(
    summary="Created remediation cards t_a1b2c3d4, t_deadbeef",  # hallucinated
    created_cards=["t_a1b2c3d4", "t_deadbeef"],                   # → gate rejects
)
```

If a `kanban_create` call fails (exception, tool_error), the card was NOT created — do not include a phantom id for it. Retry the create, or omit the id and mention the failure in your summary. The prose-scan pass also catches `t_<hex>` references in your free-form summary that don't resolve; these don't block the completion but show up as advisory warnings on the task in the dashboard.

## Block reasons that get answered fast

Bad: `"stuck"` — the human has no context.

Good: one sentence naming the specific decision you need. Leave longer context as a comment instead.

```python
kanban_comment(
    task_id=os.environ["HERMES_KANBAN_TASK"],
    body="Full context: I have user IPs from Cloudflare headers but some users are behind NATs with thousands of peers. Keying on IP alone causes false positives.",
)
kanban_block(reason="Rate limit key choice: IP (simple, NAT-unsafe) or user_id (requires auth, skips anonymous endpoints)?")
```

The block message is what appears in the dashboard / gateway notifier. The comment is the deeper context a human reads when they open the task.

### External outreach approvals must be scoped

For irreversible side effects such as email sends, SMS, or contact-form submissions, a bare `unblocked`, `approved`, or `Approved by human` comment is not enough approval evidence. Treat unblock as permission to retry the worker, not as permission to infer missing outbound details.

When blocking for human approval, ask for the smallest complete approval bundle: exact rows/vendors/recipients, send path for each item (email vs form vs no-send), approved subject/body/signature source or exact text, sender identity, form-only fields such as company/phone, stop conditions such as captcha handling, and whether already-sent rows should receive correction follow-ups. When operating the board for a user who already gave those decisions in chat, convert them into a durable Kanban comment before `unblock`, then dispatch and verify the new run status.

See `references/outbound-approval-retry.md` for a concise operator checklist and example comment shape.

## Heartbeats worth sending

Good heartbeats name progress: `"epoch 12/50, loss 0.31"`, `"scanned 1.2M/2.4M rows"`, `"uploaded 47/120 videos"`.

Bad heartbeats: `"still working"`, empty notes, sub-second intervals. Every few minutes max; skip entirely for tasks under ~2 minutes.

## Retry scenarios

If you open the task and `kanban_show` returns `runs: [...]` with one or more closed runs, you're a retry. The prior runs' `outcome` / `summary` / `error` tell you what didn't work. Don't repeat that path. Typical retry diagnostics:

- `outcome: "timed_out"` — the previous attempt hit `max_runtime_seconds`. You may need to chunk the work or shorten it.
- `outcome: "crashed"` — OOM or segfault. Reduce memory footprint.
- `outcome: "spawn_failed"` + `error: "..."` — usually a profile config issue (missing credential, bad PATH). Ask the human via `kanban_block` instead of retrying blindly.
- `outcome: "reclaimed"` + `summary: "task archived..."` — operator archived the task out from under the previous run; you probably shouldn't be running at all, check status carefully.
- `outcome: "blocked"` — a previous attempt blocked; the unblock comment should be in the thread by now.

### Operator retry after fixing a blocked worker profile

When acting as the human/operator outside a worker and the user explicitly asks to retry a blocked card after a configuration or credential fix, use the board-native recovery path rather than creating a new card:

1. Fix the profile-scoped prerequisite in the blocked assignee profile (for example, copy an OAuth token from the default profile to `~/.hermes/profiles/<assignee>/google_token.json`, set restrictive file mode such as `600`, and verify it parses/exists without printing secret contents).
2. Run `hermes kanban unblock <task_id> --reason "<short operator note>"` so the retry has durable context in the comment thread.
3. Run `hermes kanban dispatch` to spawn the ready task immediately if no dispatcher pass is already expected.
4. Verify with `hermes kanban show <task_id> --json` and report the new run id/status/PID/heartbeat. Do not claim success until the task is `done`; if it is merely `running`, say so.

Keep the operator note concise and avoid embedding secret values or token details in comments. If a downstream child depends on the retried task, mention that it remains waiting until the parent completes.

### Operator edits to approved outbound artifacts while a worker is running

If the user changes an approved outbound artifact after a send-capable worker has started (for example, edits an email subject/body/scope after credentials were provisioned), prevent a race with the old approval:

1. Inspect current task status. If a run is `running` and could perform the side effect, immediately add a durable comment with the new instruction and reclaim/block the task before editing the artifact. Prefer `hermes kanban reclaim <task_id>` for an already-running worker; use `hermes kanban block <task_id> "<reason>"` when the task is not actively claimed.
2. Apply the requested edit at the durable source of truth the worker will read (for example the Google Sheet draft range), not only as a chat reply. For subject-line normalization, update every approved row in the same scope, not just the example row, unless the user explicitly limits the edit.
3. Read back the exact target range / artifact and verify the old unsafe text is gone and the new value is present before re-enabling the worker.
4. Add a concise comment summarizing what changed and what was verified (for example: `Subject edit completed: updated Summary!L11:L20; send only these updated subject lines`).
5. Leave the task blocked/ready for the human to unblock unless the user explicitly asked you to re-run. Do not silently resume a side-effecting send after changing approval scope.

This pattern keeps the approval trail coherent: the worker sees the user's revised instruction, the durable artifact matches it, and no run can send with stale subjects or bodies while the operator is editing.

## Notification routing

You can configure the gateway to receive cross-profile Kanban task notifications by adding `notification_sources` to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.
- `notification_sources: ['*']` accepts subscriptions from all profiles.
- `notification_sources: ['default', 'zilor-ppt']` or `"default,zilor-ppt"` restricts subscriptions to specified profiles.
- Omitting the key keeps the default behavior (profile isolation).

## Do NOT

- Call `delegate_task` as a substitute for `kanban_create`. `delegate_task` is for short reasoning subtasks inside YOUR run; `kanban_create` is for cross-agent handoffs that outlive one API loop.
- Call `clarify` to ask the human a question. You are running headless — there is no live user to answer. The call will time out (default ~120s) and the task will sit silently in `running` with no signal that it needs input. Use `kanban_comment` (context) + `kanban_block(reason=...)` (decision needed) instead — the task surfaces on the board as blocked, the operator sees it, unblocks with their answer in a comment, and you respawn with the thread.
- Modify files outside `$HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACE` unless the task body says to.
- Create follow-up tasks assigned to yourself — assign to the right specialist.
- Complete a task you didn't actually finish. Block it instead.

## Pitfalls

**Task state can change between dispatch and your startup.** Between when the dispatcher claimed and when your process actually booted, the task may have been blocked, reassigned, or archived. Always `kanban_show` first. If it reports `blocked` or `archived`, stop — you shouldn't be running.

**Workspace may have stale artifacts.** Especially `dir:` and `worktree` workspaces can have files from previous runs. Read the comment thread — it usually explains why you're running again and what state the workspace is in.

**Don't rely on the CLI when the guidance is available.** The `kanban_*` tools work across all terminal backends (Docker, Modal, SSH). `hermes kanban <verb>` from your terminal tool will fail in containerized backends because the CLI isn't installed there. When in doubt, use the tool.

## CLI fallback (for scripting)

Every tool has a CLI equivalent for human operators and scripts:
- `kanban_show` ↔ `hermes kanban show <id> --json`
- `kanban_complete` ↔ `hermes kanban complete <id> --summary "..." --metadata '{...}'`
- `kanban_block` ↔ `hermes kanban block <id> "reason"`
- `kanban_create` ↔ `hermes kanban create "title" --assignee <profile> [--parent <id>]`
- etc.

Use the tools from inside an agent; the CLI exists for the human at the terminal.
